# linearRegression-faultInjection
Fault injection experiments on linear regression algorithm to UFRGS' fault tolerance course

Fault injection experiments using Carol-fi to inject fault on software level on the algorithm of linear regression, the algorithm was developed in C++ using the Python implementation of Carol-fi and also R scripts to analyze the experiment results.
